# Sonic AI - Reinforcement Learning Agent for Sonic the Hedgehog

An AI agent that learns to play Sonic the Hedgehog using reinforcement learning, inspired by projects like [Pokemon Red Experiments](https://github.com/PWhiddy/PokemonRedExperiments). This implementation uses comprehensive behavioral psychology principles and is optimized for RTX 2060 + i7-9750H + 40GB RAM systems.

## üéØ **Primary Objective: Green Hill Zone Act 3 Completion**

The AI is specifically trained to:
1. **Complete Green Hill Zone Act 3** - This is the main win condition
2. **Maximize Score** - Each episode ends at Act 3 completion, then restarts to improve scores
3. **Track High Scores** - The system logs first completion and highlights each new high score

### üèÜ High Score Tracking
- **First Completion**: Special celebration when AI first reaches Green Hill Zone Act 3
- **New High Scores**: Highlighted logs when AI beats previous best scores
- **Progress Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of completion count and score improvements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A legally obtained Sonic ROM file (already present: `roms/sonic1.md`)
- BizHawk emulator (installed: `C:\Program Files (x86)\BizHawk-2.10-win-x64`)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd sonic-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Test the input isolation system:**
   ```bash
   python test_input_isolation.py
   ```

4. **Run the AI:**
   ```bash
   python train_sonic.py --num_envs 4 --reward_mode baseline
   ```

## üßπ Process Management & Cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup
The system includes comprehensive process management to prevent hanging processes and resource conflicts:

- **Signal Handlers**: Graceful termination on Ctrl+C
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic environment and input manager shutdown
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks and terminates child processes
- **File Bridge Cleanup**: Removes temporary communication files

### Manual Cleanup
If you need to manually clean up processes:

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
python cleanup_processes.py

# Or use the training launcher (recommended)
start_training.bat
```

### Cleanup Script Features
- **Process Termination**: Kills all Python, BizHawk, and training processes
- **Resource Monitoring**: Shows CPU, memory, and GPU usage
- **File Cleanup**: Removes temporary communication files
- **System Check**: Verifies system is ready for new training sessions

### Best Practices
1. **Always run cleanup** before starting new training sessions
2. **Use Ctrl+C** to stop training gracefully
3. **Check Task Manager** if you suspect hanging processes
4. **Use the training launcher** (`start_training.bat`) for automatic cleanup

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Multi-Instance Training (4x Faster)
The system supports running multiple BizHawk instances simultaneously with isolated inputs:

```bash
# Train with 4 parallel environments
python train_sonic.py --num_envs 4 --reward_mode baseline

# A/B testing with 4 environments (2 baseline + 2 shaping)
python train_sonic.py --num_envs 4 --reward_mode both
```

### Input Isolation System
- **No Input Conflicts**: Each BizHawk window receives inputs independently
- **Windows API Integration**: Direct window messaging for precise control
- **Background Processing**: Smooth input delivery without blocking
- **Automatic Window Management**: Focus and visibility handling

### A/B Testing Framework
Compare different reward methods:
- **Baseline**: Standard reinforcement learning rewards
- **Shaping**: Susan Garrett's shaping method-inspired rewards
- **Parallel Testing**: Run both methods simultaneously

## üß† Behavioral Psychology Implementation

This AI uses all 4 operant conditioning techniques from behavioral psychology:

### 1. Positive Reinforcement (Adding Good Stimulus)
- **Ring Collection**: +15.0 reward for collecting rings
- **Enemy Defeat**: +8.0 reward for defeating enemies  
- **Power-ups**: +20.0 reward for collecting power-ups
- **Level Completion**: +1500.0 reward for finishing level
- **Checkpoints**: +100.0 reward for reaching checkpoints

### 2. Positive Punishment (Adding Bad Stimulus)
- **Game Over**: -200.0 penalty for losing all lives
- **Falling**: -15.0 penalty for falling into pits
- **Getting Stuck**: -2.0 penalty for being stuck in one place

### 3. Negative Reinforcement (Removing Bad Stimulus)
- **Forward Progress**: +2.0 reward for moving right (removes time pressure)
- **Speed Bonus**: +3.0 reward for high speed (removes slow movement penalty)
- **Height Bonus**: +1.0 reward for jumping (removes ground obstacle penalty)

### 4. Negative Punishment (Removing Good Stimulus)
- **Time Penalty**: -0.2 penalty for time passing (removes time bonus)
- **Ring Loss**: -5.0 penalty for losing rings (removes ring bonus)

### Advanced Behavioral Incentives
- **Exploration**: +1.0 reward for visiting new areas
- **Efficiency**: +2.0 reward for completing level quickly
- **Skill Bonus**: +5.0 reward for advanced moves (spin dash, homing attack)

## üõë Session Termination Conditions

The AI stops a training session when:

1. **Episode Completion**: Level is completed (100% progress)
2. **Game Over**: All lives are lost
3. **Time Limit**: Maximum steps reached (15,000 steps)
4. **Stuck Detection**: Agent remains in same position for too long
5. **Manual Interruption**: User presses Ctrl+C

## üö´ Preventing Stuck Behavior

To ensure the AI doesn't get stuck and continues progressing:

1. **Stuck Penalty**: -2.0 reward for staying in same position
2. **Exploration Bonus**: +1.0 reward for visiting new areas
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors X-coordinate movement
4. **Time Pressure**: Small time penalty encourages forward movement
5. **Jump Encouragement**: Height bonus for jumping over obstacles
6. **Speed Incentives**: Speed bonus for maintaining momentum
