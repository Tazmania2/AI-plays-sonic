## üìã Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Issue**: Training takes too long

# Solution: Reduce sample size for quick testing
python scripts/scholarly_comparison.py --sample-size 3
```

**Issue**: Out of memory errors
```bash
# Solution: Reduce batch size in config
# Edit configs/scholarly_comparison_config.yaml
agent:
  batch_size: 64  # Reduce from 128
```

**Issue**: No significant differences found
```bash
# Solution: Check if sample size is adequate
# Increase sample size for better statistical power
python scripts/scholarly_comparison.py --sample-size 15
```

**Issue**: Results directory not found
```bash
# Solution: Check if experiment completed
ls results/
# Look for most recent directory
cd results/Traditional_RL_vs_Shaping_RL_Comparison_*
```

### **Debugging Tips**

**Check Training Progress**:
```bash
# Monitor log files
tail -f results/*/logs/*.log

# Check TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir results/*/tensorboard/
```

**Verify Configuration**:
```bash
# Check config file
cat configs/scholarly_comparison_config.yaml

# Validate with test run
python scripts/scholarly_comparison.py --sample-size 1
```

**Analyze Individual Runs**:
```bash
# Examine specific run results
cat results/*/traditional_rl_run_0_seed_42.json
cat results/*/shaping_rl_run_0_seed_42.json
```
