### **Phase 2: Ring Collection (Episodes 500-1000)**
```bash
python train_sonic_simplified.py --episodes 1000
```
**Goal**: Learn to collect rings while moving

### **Phase 3: Advanced Skills (Episodes 1000+)**
```bash
python train_sonic_simplified.py --reward-style mario --episodes 2000
```
**Goal**: Learn spin dash and advanced moves

## 💡 **Key Insights from Mario AI**

### **Why Simplicity Works:**
1. **Clear Objectives**: "Move right and survive" is easier to learn
2. **Distance-Based Rewards**: Immediate, clear feedback
3. **Focused Actions**: Essential actions only
